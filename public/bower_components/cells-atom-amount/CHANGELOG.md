# Changelog

## v9.1.0
- New boolean property (`trailingZeroDecimalsHidden`) to hide the trailing zeros.

## v8.1.0
- New boolean property (`zeroDecimalsHidden`) to hide the decimal part only when it is zero (no decimals).

## v8.0.0
- Default styles (Coronita) for different sizes are now included in the component (no need to define them in a theme).
- `hidden` property is now private (not documented in public API) to avoid confusion as it is a computed property.
